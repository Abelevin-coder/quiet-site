<BaseLayout title="Advisory">
  <h1>Advisory</h1>
  <p class="muted">Financial decision advisory before capital commitment</p>

  <p>
    I advise investors, lenders, sponsors, and operators before material financial commitments are made.
    The work is focused on structural risk, downside allocation, and decision integrity under pressure.
  </p>

  <p>
    Engagements are used at two distinct stages of a financial decision cycle.

  <section class="offer">
    <h2><a href="/decision-framing">Decision Framing</a></h2>
    <p class="muted">Early-stage financial structuring</p>

    <p>
      Used when a transaction is forming but the commitment boundary,
      embedded assumptions, or downside allocation are not yet clearly defined.
    </p>

    <p>
      The objective is to ensure the decision is correctly structured
      before it advances toward formal execution.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="offer">
    <h2><a href="/commitment-review">Commitment Review</a></h2>
    <p class="muted">Pre-execution structural risk assessment</p>

    <p>
      Used when a financial commitment is near execution and downside exposure
      must be made explicit before capital is deployed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The review concludes with a written eligibility verdict:
      Proceed · Hold · Do not proceed.
