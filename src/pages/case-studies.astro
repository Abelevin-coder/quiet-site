    <h2>Grocery-Anchored Retail Center — Post-COVID Acquisition Review</h2>

    <p><strong>Context</strong><br />
      Grocery-anchored retail center in a tertiary market.
      Competing center nearby with elevated vacancy.
      Anchor included a national sporting goods tenant with uncertain long-term trajectory.
      Transaction occurred during post-COVID retail recovery.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Decision</strong><br />
      Whether to acquire given rollover risk, competitive lease pressure,
      and tertiary market contraction.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Primary Risk Factors</strong><br />
      Lease rollover competition; tenant concentration risk; market shrinkage exposure;
      reliance on future lease execution to preserve value.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Risk Mitigation Opportunity</strong><br />
      Unsubdivided pharmacy outparcel capable of separate disposition
      at a favorable cap rate, reducing basis and downside exposure.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Condition for Proceeding</strong><br />
      Blend-and-extend of key leases committed in writing prior to closing,
      supported by broker valuation.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Verdict</strong><br />
      Proceed only if lease extensions and outparcel strategy were secured before closing.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Subsequent Review</strong><br />
      After 2–3 years of stabilized cash flow during peak grocery-anchored demand
      and low-rate environment, exit timing recommended while lease term and buyer demand remained strong.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Exit Decision</strong><br />
      Sell.
