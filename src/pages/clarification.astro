<BaseLayout title="Clarification">
  <h1>Clarification</h1>
  <p class="muted">Restoring orientation before decisions form</p>

  <p>
    Clarification work is used when something feels heavy, urgent, or unclear, but there is no immediate commitment boundary yet.
  </p>

  <p>
    The aim is not to resolve the situation or decide what to do next.
    It is to restore a clear view of what is actually present.
  </p>

  <h2>What this is</h2>

  <p>
    Clarification focuses on understanding what is happening now, what is being carried, and what has not yet settled.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many situations feel urgent because multiple elements are collapsed together:
    responsibility, timing, expectation, pressure, and meaning.
    Clarification separates these without advancing them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nothing is optimized.
    Nothing is decided.
  </p>

  <h2>What I do</h2>

  <p>
    I help identify what is actually present in the situation, what is being assumed, and where pressure is being introduced prematurely.
  </p>

  <p>
    The work stays descriptive rather than directive.
    It does not produce advice, recommendations, or next steps.
  </p>

  <h2>What you receive</h2>

  <p>
    A clearer internal and structural picture of the situation as it stands.
  </p>

  <p>
    Often this is enough for urgency to reduce on its own.
    In some cases, it makes clear that no decision is required yet.
  </p>

  <h2>Relationship to eligibility</h2>

  <p>
    Clarification and eligibility serve different moments.
  </p>

  <p>
    If there is no real commitment boundary, work stays in clarification.
    If a high-stakes commitment boundary becomes clear, eligibility work may follow.
  </p>

  <p>
    You do not need to determine this in advance.
  </p>
