<h1>Clarification</h1>

<p>
Clarification is a structured conversation designed to restore orientation when a situation feels dense, distorted, or over-pressured.
</p>

<p>
This is not problem-solving, coaching, therapy, or decision-making.
Nothing is optimized. Nothing is resolved.
</p>

<h2>What this is</h2>

<p>
I work with individuals or teams when judgment feels noisy, timing feels unclear, or responsibility has become blurred.
The aim is to name what is actually present—without advancing the situation, assigning meaning, or forcing movement.
</p>

<p>
Clarification restores the conditions under which good decisions become possible later.
</p>

<h2>What happens in a session</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We slow the situation down without disengaging from it</li>
  <li>We distinguish signal from pressure</li>
  <li>We separate what is known from what is being assumed</li>
  <li>We identify where urgency is substituting for sequence</li>
  <li>We clarify where responsibility actually sits—and where it does not</li>
</ul>

<p>
No advice is given.
No direction is offered.
Nothing is framed as a recommendation.
</p>

<h2>When this is used</h2>

<p>
Clarification is useful when:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A decision feels heavy but premature</li>
  <li>Multiple narratives are competing for control</li>
  <li>Pressure is present without a clear source</li>
  <li>Progress is happening, but confidence is thinning</li>
  <li>The system feels intact, but slightly misaligned</li>
</ul>

<h2>What this produces</h2>

<p>
The outcome is not an answer.
The outcome is restored orientation.
</p>

<p>
Most people leave with:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Clearer boundaries around the situation</li>
  <li>Reduced internal noise</li>
  <li>Improved judgment timing</li>
  <li>A more accurate sense of what does and does not require action</li>
</ul>

<h2>What this is not</h2>

<p>
This is not advisory work.
I do not tell you what to do, what to choose, or what is “best.”
</p>

<p>
If a situation requires a commitment decision with consequences, that is handled separately through eligibility review.
</p>
