<BaseLayout title="Clarification">
  <h1>Clarification</h1>
  <p class="muted">Restoring orientation before decisions form</p>

  <p>
    Clarification work is used when something feels heavy, urgent, or unclear.
  </p>

  <p>
    The aim is not to resolve the situation or decide what to do next.
    It is to restore orientation so clarity can form on its own.
  </p>

  <h2>What this is</h2>

  <p>
    Clarification focuses on identifying what is preventing clarity from forming or settling.
  </p>

  <p>
    Urgency can arise from nervous system activation, or from responsibility, timing, and interpretation being carried at the same time instead of in sequence.
    Clarification determines which is occurring and separates the elements without advancing them.
  </p>

  <h2>What I do</h2>

  <p>
    I help identify what is actually present in the situation, what is being assumed, and where pressure is being introduced prematurely.
  </p>

  <p>
    The work stays descriptive rather than directive.
    I do not advise or recommend.
  </p>

  <h2>What you receive</h2>

  <p>
    A clearer internal and structural picture of the situation as it stands.
  </p>

  <p>
    In many cases, urgency reduces once elements are no longer collapsed.
    In others, it becomes clear that no decision is required yet.
  </p>

  <h2>Relationship to eligibility</h2>

  <p>
    Clarification and eligibility serve different moments.
  </p>

  <p>
    If there is no real commitment boundary, work stays in clarification.
    If a high-stakes commitment boundary becomes clear, eligibility work may follow.
  </p>

  <p>
    You do not need to determine this in advance.
  </p>
