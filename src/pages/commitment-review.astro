  <h1>Commitment Review</h1>
  <p class="muted">Pre-execution structural risk assessment</p>

  <p>
    A Commitment Review is conducted prior to signing or funding a material financial commitment.
  </p>

  <p>
    The review defines the commitment in writing, tests failure paths under stress,
    and makes downside allocation explicit before execution.
  </p>

  <p>
    The engagement concludes with a written eligibility verdict:
    Proceed · Hold · Do not proceed.
  </p>

  <h2>Scope of Review</h2>

  <p><strong>Decision definition</strong><br />
    The actual commitment being entered, stated without narrative framing.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Failure modes</strong><br />
    The specific paths through which loss occurs if assumptions fail.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Responsibility allocation</strong><br />
    Identification of which party absorbs downside in each failure case.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Required preconditions</strong><br />
    Conditions that must already be true at closing, not projected improvements.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Eligibility verdict</strong><br />
    Proceed · Hold · Do not proceed
  </p>
