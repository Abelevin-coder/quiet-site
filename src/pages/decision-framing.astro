<BaseLayout title="Decision Framing">
  <h1>Decision Framing</h1>
  <p class="muted">Restoring structural clarity before commitment</p>

  <p>
    Decision framing is used when pressure, urgency, or internal disagreement
    is narrowing the frame of a high-stakes choice.
  </p>

  <p>
    The work identifies what decision is actually being made,
    separates interpretation from structure,
    and restores correct sequencing before commitment.
  </p>

  <h2>What I do</h2>

  <p>
    I clarify:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>What the real commitment boundary is</li>
    <li>Where responsibility and downside sit</li>
    <li>What assumptions are being advanced as facts</li>
    <li>Whether timing pressure is structural or psychological</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The objective is not premature resolution.
    It is structural accuracy before irreversible movement.
  </p>
