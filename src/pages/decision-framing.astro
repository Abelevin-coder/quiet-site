<BaseLayout title="Decision Framing">
  <h1>Decision Framing</h1>
  <p class="muted">Early-stage financial decision structuring</p>

  <p>
    Decision Framing is used before a capital commitment is fully formed.
    A transaction may be advancing, terms may be circulating, and momentum may be building —
    but the real commitment boundary is not yet clearly defined.
  </p>

  <p>
    This engagement clarifies what is actually being contemplated, what assumptions are embedded
    in the structure, and where financial exposure would sit if those assumptions fail.
  </p>

  <h2>When this is useful</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Internal disagreement about whether to proceed</li>
    <li>Unclear downside allocation in early deal structuring</li>
    <li>Timing pressure compressing risk assessment</li>
    <li>Capital being informally committed before formal review</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What the session covers</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>What decision is actually being made</li>
    <li>What must be true for the structure to work</li>
    <li>Where risk concentrates if performance underperforms</li>
    <li>Whether the decision is mature enough to proceed to formal review</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The objective is not to reach a verdict.
    It is to ensure that the decision is correctly defined before capital, reputation,
    or governance position are committed.
  </p>

  <h2>Engagement Structure</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Single defined decision or transaction</li>
    <li>90-minute structured session</li>
    <li>Written structural summary delivered within 24 hours</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="muted">
    Engagements are fixed-fee and scoped in advance.
