<BaseLayout title="Eligibility Review">

<h1>Eligibility Review</h1>

<p>
An eligibility review is used before making a financial commitement when you want to be sure responsibility and risk are correctly placed.
</p>

<p>
Typically prudent when things look viable on paper and making a mistake would be costly.
</p>

<h2>What I do</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I assess the salient risks inherent in the proposal</li>
  <li>identify where responsibility and downside will land</li>
  <li>and outline what needs be true for the commitment to make sense</li>
</ul>

<p>
I do not decide for you. But this clarifies what a commitment would entail.
</p>

<h2>What the review covers</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>What decision is actually being made</strong><br />
    The real commitment, stripped of narrative and framing.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Primary failure modes</strong><br />
    How this breaks structurally, independent of optimism or effort.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Where responsibility truly sits</strong><br />
    Who absorbs downside cost.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>What must already be true</strong><br />
    Conditions that must exist now — not aspirational assumptions.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Eligibility verdict</strong><br />
    Proceed · Hold · Do not proceed
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Common Scenarios</h2>

<p>
High-stakes decisions where errors are expensive and difficult to reverse, including:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>acquisitions and dispositions</li>
  <li>financing and capital structures</li>
  <li>lending and credit decisions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example — Real estate</h2>

<p>
I reviewed a proposed acquisition where the sponsor planned to close using bridge financing with an assumed refinance inside the term.
</p>

<p>
The review clarified that the actual decision was not only the property, but entering a debt structure highly dependant on future capital markets conditions.
</p>

<p>
The downside risks were rate movement, refinance timing outside the sponsor’s control, stacked on management execution during stabilization.
</p>

<p>
Responsibility mapping showed that if refinance conditions weren't timely, downside would sit with the investors’s equity, not with the management.
</p>

<p>
The review identified operating stability, reserves, and execution control as conditions that were required before commitment.
</p>

<p>
The eligibility verdict was <strong>Hold</strong>, because the structure relied heavily on conditions that were not yet present, despite the deal appearing attractive on paper.
</p>

<h2>Example — Lending</h2>

<p>
I reviewed a proposed asset-backed lending structure where a loan was being originated against operating asset as collateral.
</p>

<p>
The review clarified that the decision being made was the conversion of operating volatility into lender credit risk, rather than a standard collateralized loan.
</p>

<p>
Primary failure modes included asset impairment, mismanagement under stress, and enforcement challenges in downside scenarios.
</p>

<p>
Responsibility analysis showed that risk was being shifted away from the borrower’s balance sheet and toward the lender through structure, making default a lender's problem mor than a borrower's problem.
</p>

<p>
The review identified durable cash flow, borrower risk retention, and enforceable collateral security as conditions that need to exist prior to commitment.
</p>

<p>
The eligibility verdict was <strong>Hold</strong>, because downside responsibility was not yet correctly structured.
