<BaseLayout title="Eligibility Review">
  <h1>Eligibility Review</h1>
  <p class="muted">Structural risk assessment before commitment</p>

  <p>
    An eligibility review is used to determine whether a proposed financial decision is eligible to be made based on structure and risk placement.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is typically used when something looks viable on paper and the decision is irreversible.
  </p>

  <h2>What I do</h2>

  <p>
    I identify where risk is being carried in the structure, assess the salient failure modes, and clarify where responsibility and downside will land.
    The work makes explicit what must already be true for the commitment to make sense.
  </p>

  <p>
    I do not decide for you.<br />
    The work clarifies what a commitment would actually entail.
  </p>

  <h2>What the review covers</h2>

  <p><strong>What decision is actually being made</strong><br />
    The real commitment, stripped of narrative or framing.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Primary failure modes</strong><br />
    Where and how risk concentrates if conditions deteriorate.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Where responsibility truly sits</strong><br />
    Who absorbs downside cost when failure modes are activated.
  </p>

  <p><strong>What must already be true</strong><br />
    Conditions that must exist now, not assumptions about future improvement.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Eligibility verdict</strong><br />
    Proceed · Hold · Do not proceed
  </p>

  <h2>Common scenarios</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>acquisitions and dispositions</li>
    <li>financing and capital structures</li>
    <li>lending and credit decisions</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Example — Real estate</h2>

  <p>
    I reviewed a proposed acquisition where the sponsor planned to close using bridge financing with an assumed refinance inside the term.
  </p>

  <p>
    The review clarified that the decision being made was not only the purchase of the property, but entry into a debt structure highly dependent on future capital markets conditions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Primary downside risks included rate movement, refinance timing outside the sponsor’s control, and execution risk during stabilization.
  </p>

  <p>
    Responsibility mapping showed that if refinancing was delayed or unavailable, downside would sit with investor equity rather than with the operating structure.
  </p>

  <p>
    The review identified operating stability, reserves, and execution control as conditions that needed to be in place prior to commitment.
  </p>

  <p>
    The eligibility verdict was <strong>Hold</strong>, because the structure relied on conditions that were not yet present, despite the deal appearing attractive on paper.
  </p>

  <h2>Example — Lending</h2>

  <p>
    I reviewed a proposed asset-backed lending structure where a loan was being originated against operating assets as collateral.
  </p>

  <p>
    The review clarified that the decision being made was the conversion of operating volatility into lender credit risk, rather than a conventional collateralized loan.
  </p>

  <p>
    Primary failure modes included asset impairment, mismanagement under stress, and enforcement friction in downside scenarios.
  </p>

  <p>
    Responsibility analysis showed that risk was being shifted away from the borrower’s balance sheet and toward the lender through structure, making default primarily a lender problem rather than a borrower problem.
  </p>

  <p>
    The review identified durable cash flow, borrower risk retention, and enforceable collateral security as conditions that needed to exist prior to commitment.
  </p>

  <p>
    The eligibility verdict was <strong>Hold</strong>, because downside responsibility was not yet correctly structured.
