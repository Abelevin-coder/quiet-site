<h1>Eligibility</h1>

<p>
Eligibility review is a pre-commitment assessment conducted before an irreversible decision is made.
It is used when the cost of being wrong is non-trivial and the system needs structural clarity before binding itself.
</p>

<p>
This is not advice, advocacy, or recommendation.
I do not optimize outcomes or decide on behalf of another party.
</p>

<h2>What this is</h2>

<p>
I review what decision is actually being made, where responsibility will land, and what must already be true for the commitment to be coherent.
The work is structural: it names constraints, failure modes, and responsibility placement without advancing the decision itself.
</p>

<h2>The deliverable</h2>

<p>
The output is a short written document. It is not a plan.
It is a clarity artifact intended to be used prior to commitment.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>What decision is actually being made</strong><br />
    A precise description of the commitment under consideration, stripped of framing or narrative overlay.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Primary failure modes</strong><br />
    The most likely ways the commitment fails structurally, independent of optimism, effort, or intent.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Where responsibility truly sits</strong><br />
    An explicit mapping of who carries consequence if the commitment succeeds, degrades, or fails.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>What must be true before commitment</strong><br />
    Conditions that must already be satisfied for the commitment to be viable, not aspirational.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Eligibility verdict</strong><br />
    A structural verdict based on readiness: <strong>Proceed</strong>, <strong>Pause</strong>, or <strong>Stop</strong>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Eligibility verdict</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Proceed</strong> — conditions are met and responsibility is correctly placed.</li>
  <li><strong>Pause</strong> — conditions are incomplete, unclear, or misaligned.</li>
  <li><strong>Stop</strong> — the commitment misplaces responsibility or creates non-recoverable risk.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example — Real estate</h2>

<p>
A sponsor is considering closing on an acquisition with bridge financing.
</p>

<p>
The review clarifies:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>What decision is actually being made</strong><br />
    Entering a debt structure with explicit refinancing dependency.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Primary failure modes</strong><br />
    Rate movement, capital markets timing, and operational drag.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Where responsibility truly sits</strong><br />
    Who absorbs downside if refinancing conditions deteriorate.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>What must be true before commitment</strong><br />
    Operating stability, sufficient capital reserves, and control over execution.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The eligibility verdict may be <strong>Pause</strong> if the structure relies on conditions not yet present, even if the opportunity appears attractive.
</p>

<h2>Example — Business decision</h2>

<p>
An operator is considering expanding a trucking operation by adding additional vehicles under a new financing structure.
</p>

<p>
The review clarifies:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>What decision is actually being made</strong><br />
    Committing to fixed obligations that convert variable operating risk into personal or balance-sheet liability.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Primary failure modes</strong><br />
    Demand volatility, regulatory disruption, maintenance downtime, and margin compression under leverage.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Where responsibility truly sits</strong><br />
    Whether downside is absorbed by the operating entity, the individual operator, or shifted upstream to lenders or vendors.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>What must be true before commitment</strong><br />
    Proven unit economics, operational slack, regulatory continuity, and the ability to withstand adverse cycles without forced action.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The eligibility verdict may be <strong>Pause</strong> if expansion converts uncertainty into irreversible obligation before the system has demonstrated resilience.
