<BaseLayout title="Eligibility Review">

<h1>Eligibility Review</h1>

<p>
An eligibility review is used when you are close to committing to a decision that will be costly or difficult to unwind — and you want to be sure responsibility and risk are correctly placed before you bind yourself.
</p>

<p>
It is most useful when things look viable on paper, effort is available, and the downside of being wrong would matter.
</p>

<h2>What this is</h2>

<p>
I review:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>what decision is actually being made</li>
  <li>where responsibility and downside will land</li>
  <li>what must already be true for the commitment to make sense</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is not advice and it does not optimize outcomes. I do not decide for you.
</p>

<p>
The work stays structural. It clarifies whether the commitment is ready, not whether it is attractive.
</p>

<h2>What you receive</h2>

<p>
A short written document used before commitment.
</p>

<p>
It is not a plan and it does not advance execution.
</p>

<p>
It is designed to be read once and used to decide whether to proceed, pause, or stop.
</p>

<h2>What the review covers</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>What decision is actually being made</strong><br />
    The real commitment, stripped of narrative and framing.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Primary failure modes</strong><br />
    How this breaks structurally, independent of optimism or effort.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Where responsibility truly sits</strong><br />
    Who absorbs cost if things degrade or fail.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>What must already be true</strong><br />
    Conditions that must exist now — not aspirational assumptions.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Eligibility verdict</strong><br />
    Proceed · Hold · Do not proceed
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Where this is commonly used</h2>

<p>
High-stakes decisions where errors are expensive and difficult to reverse, including:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>acquisitions and dispositions</li>
  <li>financing and capital structures</li>
  <li>lending and credit decisions</li>
  <li>contractual or governance commitments</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example — Real estate</h2>

<p>
I reviewed a proposed acquisition where the sponsor planned to close using bridge financing with an assumed refinance inside the term.
</p>

<p>
The review clarified that the actual decision was not the purchase itself, but entering a debt structure whose success depended on future capital markets conditions.
</p>

<p>
The primary failure modes were rate movement, refinance timing outside the sponsor’s control, and execution drag during stabilization.
</p>

<p>
Responsibility mapping showed that if refinance conditions deteriorated, downside would sit with the sponsor’s equity and personal guarantees, not with the structure itself.
</p>

<p>
The review identified operating stability, reserves, and execution control as conditions that were required before commitment, not after closing.
</p>

<p>
The eligibility verdict was <strong>Hold</strong>, because the structure relied on conditions that were not yet present, despite the deal appearing attractive on paper.
</p>

<h2>Example — Lending</h2>

<p>
I reviewed a proposed asset-backed lending structure where credit was being extended against operating assets under a new enforcement framework.
</p>

<p>
The review clarified that the decision being made was the conversion of operating volatility into lender credit risk, rather than a standard collateralized loan.
</p>

<p>
Primary failure modes included asset impairment under stress, leverage compression, and enforcement friction in downside scenarios.
</p>

<p>
Responsibility analysis showed that risk was being shifted away from the borrower’s balance sheet and toward the lender through structure, rather than absorbed through retained exposure.
</p>

<p>
The review identified durable cash flow, real risk retention, and enforceable security as conditions that needed to exist prior to commitment.
</p>

<p>
The eligibility verdict was <strong>Hold</strong>, because downside responsibility was not yet correctly placed.
