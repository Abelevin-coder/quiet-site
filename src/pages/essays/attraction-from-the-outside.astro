<BaseLayout title="Attraction From the Outside">
  <h1>Attraction From the Outside</h1>
  <p><em>Abe Levin · February 1, 2026</em></p>

  <p>
    For a long time, being attractive was the organizing principle of my life.
    Not only in relationships, but everywhere else too. It promised visibility,
    momentum, and reward. It was an energizing experience that flowed. I moved
    through the world expecting that if I kept becoming more attractive it would
    grow and fill in everything else behind it.
  </p>

  <p>
    For a time, it felt that way. Things moved more easily. I was fluent, and I
    let it carry me internally, socially, and professionally. Attention
    followed. Opportunity followed. There was a sense that I was on the right
    track without needing to think too much about where it led.
  </p>

  <p>
    What made it convincing was how complete it felt. I could be sitting across
    from someone, sharing a drink, trading a few easy lines of conversation, and
    the moment already felt full. There was warmth, focus, a sense of closeness
    that didn’t require anything more to be known. Nothing needed to unfold. The
    experience felt finished as it was happening.
  </p>

  <p>That same feeling returned again and again, unchanged.</p>

  <p>
    Over time, there was a slight thinning that didn’t relent. Not exhaustion or
    burnout, but something quieter. A sense of suspension, as if something
    essential was being skipped rather than missing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Only later did it become clear that nothing was arriving. Whatever should
    have come next kept being deferred. Still, I wasn’t asking what was missing.
    I was asking how to keep this going long enough for something to finally
    settle.
  </p>

  <p>
    Refine it, that was the answer. Attraction needs better calibration, cleaner
    execution, more consistency. If it isn’t settling, it must not yet be
    sufficient. So, I paid attention to how I appeared, how I moved, how things
    landed with others. It was a discipline of perfection that absorbed my
    experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    That sense of completeness was convincing. Attraction carried enough
    immediacy to feel alive, an intensity that didn’t dim. I stayed engaged.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over time, a pattern became hard to ignore. That same sense of completeness
    repeated without deepening. Each encounter was isolated with nothing carried
    over from one to the next.
  </p>

  <p>Time passed and nothing accumulated. Familiarity brought ease, not closeness.</p>

  <p>
    Not a disappointment exactly. More like a quiet mismatch between how
    complete something appeared and how little it seemed to carry forward. I
    started losing the sense that anything was actually building.
  </p>

  <p>
    Instead of questioning where this was going, I questioned myself again. I
    assumed I wasn’t leaning in far enough or staying long enough to let things
    unfold the way they were meant to. The answer was more patience and trust in
    what already felt real.
  </p>

  <p>I continued to live inside moments that felt vivid while they were happening.</p>

  <p>
    What eventually failed was not attraction, and not effort. It was endurance.
  </p>

  <p>
    The strain didn’t show up as crisis. It showed up as maintenance. Each
    interaction required a small but constant act of holding—holding interest,
    holding openness, holding possibility. Nothing was wrong enough to stop, but
    nothing was stable enough to rest on.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over time, I noticed how much regulation was happening in the background.
    Attention had to be managed. Exposure had to be calibrated. I stayed alert
    to signals, to shifts in tone, to ascertain whether something was cooling or
    still alive. I remained slightly mobilized, as if readiness itself were the
    condition for staying connected.
  </p>

  <p>
    I could feel the cost in how little margin remained. Not exhaustion—there
    was still energy—but a narrowing. Fewer interactions that felt complete.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is where the system compensates. When continuity isn’t provided
    externally, it gets simulated internally.
  </p>

  <p>
    I carried threads forward in my head. I maintained coherence where none was
    being built. I supplied meaning where none was arriving. Attraction was
    doing the signalling, but something else was doing the holding.
  </p>

  <p>
    That imbalance can’t persist indefinitely, because it’s asymmetrical. One
    side keeps supplying structure, time, and regulation; the other never takes
    them up. Eventually, the cost is felt as strain without return.
  </p>

  <p>
    That was the point where continuation stopped being a choice. Not because I
    decided differently, but because my system no longer supported the load. What
    had been possible through effort alone was no longer possible at all.
  </p>

  <p>
    I couldn’t tell whether what had failed was my capacity to continue, or the
    expectation that attraction was meant to do more than it can.
  </p>

  <p>
    But, what changed wasn’t attraction itself, but where it began to sit.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once it stopped carrying continuity, it returned to what it actually does.
    It would register. It could spark. Then it passed. I didn’t need it to give
    momentum, or depth, or to hold an outcome.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once time was allowed back into the process. Interest no longer implied
    availability and presence no longer required extension. If something
    continued, it did so because something else had entered—not because I was
    holding it together.
  </p>

  <p>
    And when connection does arrive, it arrives differently. Not complete all at
    once but open and unfolding. Nothing needs to be managed into place. Nothing
    is asking to be sustained ahead of itself.
  </p>

  <p>
    The relief wasn’t in stopping. It was in no longer asking attraction to do
    the work of time.
