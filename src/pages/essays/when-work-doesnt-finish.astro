  <p>Something subtle is happening in how work unfolds.</p>

  <p>
    Another question is asked while earlier ones are still settling. A decision is made, and
    attention is already being pulled toward the next. There is little space between moments of
    engagement.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jim B., a senior engineer, finishes a video call where an AI system generated three solution
    options in real time. He returns to his desk and drafts a response to a client issue his
    associate mentioned earlier that day. The workday continues.
  </p>

  <p>
    By midafternoon, he has made a dozen decisions, most of them light. There’s still some work
    to get through, nothing major.
  </p>

  <p>
    Somewhere in that movement, Jim notices he has less to give than he expects. He is exhausted
    in a way that is difficult to account for, since nothing has felt especially hard.
  </p>

  <p>
    This strain doesn't resemble the burnout people are used to recognizing. Most people
    experiencing it are competent and engaged. They are doing well by any external measure.
    What’s missing is time for the person to fully return before the next engagement begins.
  </p>

  <p>Earlier in his career, Jim’s days had a different shape.</p>

  <p>
    A problem would arrive in the morning and stay with him for a while. He would sketch possible
    approaches, test one, discard it, return to the problem after lunch. There was time to sit
    with uncertainty without needing to resolve it immediately.
  </p>

  <p>
    When a decision was finally made, it tended to close something. The work moved on and the
    previous task felt finished. There was space to notice what had worked, what hadn’t, and what
    would need adjusting next time.
  </p>

  <p>By the end of the day, the work felt complete, and Jim felt settled.</p>

  <p>
    In many work environments, pauses were inherent in processes. Even delays created natural
    boundaries between cycles of attention, decision, and action. Those boundaries gave the
    person room to come back, without having to resolve uncertainty right away. The system’s
    internal balance had time to re-stabilize before the next demand arrived.
  </p>

  <p>Those pauses did specific work. They gave the person time to recover between engagements.</p>

  <p>
    Without those pauses, things stop finishing cleanly. One engagement rolls into the next and
    obligations get stacked before there is room to choose how to meet them.
  </p>

  <p>
    When engagement recurs too quickly, people adapt. They move faster, keep things lighter, and
    rely on urgency to stay oriented. Nothing about this requires rejecting new tools or slowing
    work for its own sake.
  </p>

  <p>
    The cost only shows up as gradual thinning—a subtle loss of range that doesn't map to
    exhaustion or overload. This is why people dismiss their own fatigue. The evidence suggests
    everything is working. What's missing isn't visible in output. It's missing in what the
    system can no longer hold between outputs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nothing is wrong. People are simply being asked to move faster than they can finish.
