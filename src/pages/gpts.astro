  <h2 id="gpt-disclaimer-title">Disclaimer</h2>

  <p>These GPT assistants are experimental, purpose-scoped tools.</p>

  <p>
    Each assistant is configured with specific constraints intended to support clarity,
    sequencing, and non-directive interaction within a defined scope. As with any language
    model, behavior is not fully reliable. At times, an assistant may respond outside its
    intended scope or fail to adhere to its constraints.
  </p>

  <p>
    Responses should be read as contextual and provisional, not as a replacement human judgment.
  </p>

  <p>If a response feels misaligned or excessive, it should be set aside.</p>
