  <p>
    This site is a library of work concerned with clarity before action.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many situations that arrive with stress, urgency, or indecision are not indicative of 
    a lack of effort or intelligence. They arise when someone is asked to move forward
before they are oriented to what decision is actually being made.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the pages there are written pieces, lines that interrupt habitual thinking, and some tools.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nothing in this site is meant to persuade or guide.
  </p>

  <p>
    The aim is simple: reduce pressure long enough for orientation to return.
  </p>

  <h2>Availability</h2>

  <p>
    When needed, this kind of work tends to fall into two forms:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Clarification</strong> — restoring capacity to see a situation clearly before deciding.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Eligibility</strong> — reviewing a high-stakes commitment before proceeding.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If it is not obvious which applies, the context will usually surface the right direction.
  </p>

  <h2>Email</h2>

  <p>
    <a href="mailto:abe@abelevin.net">abe@abelevin.net</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    If you want to include context, the minimum useful items are:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>What’s going on, in plain terms</li>
    <li>What feels unclear right now</li>
    <li>Whether a decision is pending (and what it is, if so)</li>
    <li>Any real time constraints</li>
  </ul>
</BaseLayout>
