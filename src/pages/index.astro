  <p>
    This site is a library of work about judgment under pressure.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many failures attributed to bad information or weak reasoning begin earlier —
    when a decision is advanced before its structure, exposure, and responsibility
    are fully seen.
  </p>

  <p>
    The essays examine how pressure narrows judgment, and how sequencing restores it.
    I provide advisory review when commitments are material and irreversible.

  <h2>Advisory</h2>

  <p>
    I work with founders, operators, investors, and institutional leaders
    before high-stakes commitments are made.
  </p>

  <p>
    The role is not to replace your judgment.
    It is to define what decision is actually being made,
    map where risk and responsibility sit,
    and clarify what must already be true for the commitment to make structural sense.
  </p>

  See: <a href="/clarification">Decision Framing</a> · <a href="/eligibility">Commitment Review</a>
</p>

  <p>
    Typical contexts include capital allocation, lending, acquisitions,
    governance tension, and irreversible decisions.
