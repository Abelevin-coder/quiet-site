  <p>
    This site contains writing about financial decisions made under pressure.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many losses blamed on poor analysis begin earlier —
    when a commitment moves forward before the downside is written down:
    how loss occurs, and who absorbs it.
  </p>

  <p>
    The essays examine how decisions compress under time and capital pressure.
    Advisory work applies the same discipline to live transactions before capital is signed or funded.
  </p>

  <p>
    Reviews have included bridge-financed real estate acquisitions,
    asset-backed lending structures, private credit transactions,
    and capital allocation decisions for closely held sponsors.

  <h2>Advisory</h2>

  <p>
    Engagements typically begin after a loss, or when a pending commitment carries material downside.
  </p>

  <p>
    The review defines the decision in writing, lists primary failure paths,
    and identifies who bears the loss in each scenario.
  </p>
