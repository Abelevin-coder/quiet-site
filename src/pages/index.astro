  <p>
    This site is a library of work about judgment under pressure.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many failures attributed to bad information or weak reasoning begin earlier —
    when a decision is advanced before its structure, exposure, and responsibility
    are fully seen.
  </p>

  <p>
    The essays here examine how pressure narrows judgment.
    My advisory work applies that analysis when real commitments are at stake.

  <h2>Advisory</h2>

  <p>
    I work with founders, operators, investors, and institutional leaders
    before high-stakes commitments are made.
  </p>

  <p>
    The role is not to decide for you.
    It is to identify what decision is actually being made,
    where risk and responsibility sit,
    and what must already be true for the commitment to make structural sense.
  </p>

  <p>
    Typical contexts include capital allocation, lending, acquisitions,
    governance tension, and irreversible timing decisions.
