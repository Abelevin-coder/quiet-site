  `My aunt, she married my uncle – he was great, they had 3 cousins. I used to play with one when I was younger, the second cousin wasn’t as closely related so I knew him less until one Sunday, he was sent home from school early – once removed. The 3rd cousin opened a shop when he got older, but we weren’t really playing then anymore, so we just exchanged post card.`,
  `I took time off to catch up. I returned ahead of schedule.`,
  `My friend said to me “I wish you that your dreams come true”. I couldn’t sleep all night, so I slept in the day. It felt like a dream, I pinched myself, but it didn’t work. What a nightmare.`
