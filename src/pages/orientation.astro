<BaseLayout title="Orientation">
  <h1>Orientation</h1>

  <p>
    This site is a library of work concerned with clarity before action.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many situations that arrive as stress, urgency, or indecision are not caused
    by a lack of effort or intelligence. They arise when a system is being asked
    to move before it is properly oriented—before it is clear what decision is
    actually being made, where responsibility sits, or what conditions are
    already real.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some pages here are written pieces.
    Some interrupt habitual thinking.
    Some are tools.
  </p>

  <p>
    None of them are meant to persuade, motivate, or instruct.
  </p>

  <p>
    They are meant to slow the moment just enough for orientation to return.
  </p>

  <h2>Two kinds of work appear here</h2>

  <p>
    You do not need to decide which applies to you.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sometimes what is needed is clarification—restoring a clear view of what is
    happening, what is being carried, and what is not yet ready to resolve.
  </p>

  <p>
    Other times, a system is approaching a point of commitment—financial,
    operational, reputational, or relational—where a structural eligibility
    review is appropriate before proceeding.
  </p>

  <p>
    From the outside, these can look the same.
    They often are not.
  </p>

  <p>
    If there is no immediate commitment boundary, work begins with clarification.
    If there is a real, high-stakes commitment boundary, eligibility may follow.
  </p>

  <p>
    You do not need to diagnose this in advance.
  </p>

  <h2>If you want to reach out</h2>

  <p>
    You can send a short note by email.
  </p>

  <p>
    Include whatever feels relevant:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>What’s going on, in plain terms</li>
    <li>What feels unclear right now</li>
    <li>Whether a decision is pending (and what it is, if so)</li>
    <li>Any time constraints that are already real</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You do not need to decide what kind of work this is.
    I will sort that from what you send.
