<BaseLayout title="Orientation">
  <h1>Orientation</h1>

  <p>
    This site is a placement surface for work that already exists.
    It is not organized as a pitch, a feed, or a sequence to follow.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are deciding where to start, use the labels as a map:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Readings</strong> — essays and books-in-progress.</li>
    <li><strong>GPTs</strong> — links to the published tools.</li>
    <li><strong>Or lines</strong> — short lines that reveal on contact.</li>
    <li><strong>Clarification</strong> — sessions for restoring framing without deciding for you.</li>
    <li><strong>Eligibility</strong> — pre-commitment review for high-stakes decisions.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Nothing here requires agreement, follow-through, or interpretation.
    Use what’s useful. Leave the rest.
  </p>
</BaseLayout>
