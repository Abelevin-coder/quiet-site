<BaseLayout title="Orientation">
  <h1>Orientation</h1>

  <p>
    This site is a library of work concerned with clarity before action.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many situations that arrive as stress, urgency, or indecision are not caused by
    a lack of effort or intelligence. They arise when a system is being asked to move
    before it is properly oriented—before it is clear what decision is actually being made,
    where responsibility sits, or what conditions are already real.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some pages here are written pieces. Some interrupt habitual thinking. Some are tools.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nothing here is meant to persuade, motivate, or instruct.
  </p>

  <p>
    The aim is simple: reduce pressure long enough for orientation to return.
  </p>

  <h2>Availability</h2>

  <p>
    When needed, work tends to fall into two forms:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Clarification</strong> — restoring a clear view of what is present, without advancing a decision.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Eligibility</strong> — reviewing a high-stakes commitment boundary before proceeding.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If it is not obvious which applies, start with what is present; the form can be determined from that.
  </p>

  <h2>Email</h2>

  <p>
    <a href="mailto:abe@abelevin.net">abe@abelevin.net</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    If you want to include context, the minimum useful items are:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>What’s going on, in plain terms</li>
    <li>What feels unclear right now</li>
    <li>Whether a decision is pending (and what it is, if so)</li>
    <li>Any time constraints that are already real</li>
  </ul>
</BaseLayout>
