  <h1>Pre-commitment Review</h1>

  <h2>What this is</h2>
  <p>
    I conduct pre-commitment review before an irreversible decision is made. The work is structural. I examine whether a proposed decision is eligible to proceed based on what is being committed, where responsibility actually settles, and whether the system is ready to carry the consequences of the decision being considered.

This is done prior to action or capital deployment.
  </p>

  <h2>What it is not</h2>
  <p>
    This is not advice. I do not tell you what to
    do, what to choose, or what is “best.”
  </p>

  <h2>When it is used</h2>
  <p>
    I use pre-commitment review when a system is approaching a point of no return—financial, operational, relational, or reputational—and clarity must be restored before commitment occurs.
  </p>

<h2>Example — Real estate</h2>

<p>
A sponsor is considering closing on an acquisition with bridge financing.
</p>

<p>
The review clarifies:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>What decision is actually being made</strong><br />
    Entering a debt structure with explicit refinancing dependency.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Primary failure modes</strong><br />
    Rate movement, capital markets timing, and operational drag.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Where responsibility truly sits</strong><br />
    Who absorbs downside if refinancing conditions deteriorate.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>What must be true before commitment</strong><br />
    Operating stability, sufficient capital reserves, and control over execution.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The eligibility verdict may be <strong>Pause</strong> if the structure relies on conditions not yet present, even if the opportunity appears attractive.
</p>

<h2>Example — Business decision</h2>

<p>
An operator is considering expanding a trucking operation by adding additional vehicles under a new financing structure.
</p>

<p>
The review clarifies:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>What decision is actually being made</strong><br />
    Committing to fixed obligations that convert variable operating risk into personal or balance-sheet liability.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Primary failure modes</strong><br />
    Demand volatility, regulatory disruption, maintenance downtime, and margin compression under leverage.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Where responsibility truly sits</strong><br />
    Whether downside is absorbed by the operating entity, the individual operator, or shifted upstream to lenders or vendors.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>What must be true before commitment</strong><br />
    Proven unit economics, operational slack, regulatory continuity, and the ability to withstand adverse cycles without forced action.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The eligibility verdict may be <strong>Pause</strong> if expansion converts uncertainty into irreversible obligation before the system has demonstrated resilience.
