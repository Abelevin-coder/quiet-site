<BaseLayout title="Pre-commitment">
  <h1>Pre-commitment</h1>

  <h2>What this is</h2>
  <p>
    I do pre-commitment review before an irreversible decision is made. I review
    responsibility placement, sequencing, and constraints—without trying to
    optimize outcomes or predict results.
  </p>

  <h2>What it is not</h2>
  <p>
    This is not advice, advocacy, or recommendation. I do not tell you what to
    do, what to choose, or what is “best.” I describe what is present and what a
    commitment would bind.
  </p>

  <h2>When it is used</h2>
  <p>
    I use this when a system is approaching a point of no return and clarity
    must be restored before commitment occurs.
  </p>
